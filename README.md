This is a chocolatey script that has most of the things that are required for a windows software developer starting from scratch.
I also included ssms and sql server express but they threw errors and I removed them altogether.
This helps a lot with clean windows instalations when you need to have everything installed.
Simply run the script and then go grab a coffee.
